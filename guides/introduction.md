# Introduction

## Our new V2 API is available!

We're happy to announce that a v2 version of the Lunch Money API is now available.   This version addresses much of the feedback we got from the developer community about our initial API, including the request to provide an OpenAPI Specification for the API.

You can now explore the API directly from the [API Playground in these docs](../lunch-money-api-v2-reference#description/overview).

We recommend that you use the v2 API if you are just getting started with the Lunch Money API or if you are starting a new project.

## Guides

Checkout out our [Guides](./guides/getting-started) for info on getting started, dealing with API responses, or getting inspiration from some of the [awesome projects](https://github.com/lunch-money/awesome-lunchmoney/tree/main) built by members of our community.

## Migration

You can still find the documentation for our v1 API [here](./legacy-apis/api-v1-reference/assets) along with a [Migration Guide](./legacy-apis/migrating-from-api-v1-to-v2) that provides information about the differences between the two versions of the APIs.
