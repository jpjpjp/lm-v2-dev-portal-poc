# Introduction

## Welcome to the new Lunch Money Developer Portal Preview

We're happy to announce that the Lunch Money v2 API is now available for community developer testing. This version addresses much of the feedback we received from the developer community about our API, including the request to provide an OpenAPI Specification for the API.

You can now explore the API directly from the [API Playground in these docs](../lunch-money-api-v2-reference#description/overview). From here you can interact with a mock service to understand how the API functions without modifying any actual Lunch Money data. You can also access a working implementation of the v2 API. We strongly encourage reviewers to create a test budget with example data as the first step to interacting with the v2 API.


## Guides

Checkout out our [Guides](./guides/getting-started) for info on getting started, dealing with API responses, or getting inspiration from some of the [awesome projects](https://github.com/lunch-money/awesome-lunchmoney/tree/main) built by members of our community.

## Migration

You can still find the documentation for our v1 API [here](./legacy-apis/api-v1-reference/assets) along with a [Migration Guide](./legacy-apis/migrating-from-api-v1-to-v2) that provides information about the differences between the two versions of the APIs.
