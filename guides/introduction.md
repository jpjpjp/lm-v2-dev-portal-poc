# Introduction

## Welcome to the new Lunch Money Developer Portal Preview

We're happy to announce that the Lunch Money v2 API is now available for community developer testing. This version addresses much of the feedback we received from the developer community about our API, including the request to provide an OpenAPI Specification for the API.

You can now explore the API directly from the [API Playground in these docs]((https://lm-v2-api-evaluation-service.apidocumentation.com/lunch-money-api-v2-reference)). From here you can interact with a mock service to understand how the API functions without modifying any actual Lunch Money data. You can also access a working implementation of the v2 API. We strongly encourage reviewers to [create a test budget with example data](https://lm-v2-api-evaluation-service.apidocumentation.com/lunch-money-developer-docs/guides/getting-started)) as the first step to interacting with the v2 API.


## Things to look for

While it's never too late to provide feedback on the API design itself, we are particularly interested in hearing about:

- cases where the API function differs from the docs
- doc errors in general (spelling, grammar, you name it!)
- unexpected behavior (500 responses, etc)
  
The best way to get to provide feedback is to [join our Discord community](https://discord.gg/vSz6jjZuj8) and chat with us in the `ðŸ’»-developer-api` channel! 

You can also [email our Developer Advocate](mailto:jp@lunchmoney.app).

## Migration

If you'd like to start thinking about migrating existing apps, we have an initial [Migration Guide](./apis/v1/migrating-to-v2). Feedback on this welcome as well!

## New Developer Portal

We are also interested to hear your feedback on this proposed Developer Portal. Much of the content are still being created, but we'd like your opinion on the direction.

- Is this format useful?
- What's missing?
- Any ideas for improvement?

Please don't hesitate to reach out with any feedback via email or discord.   We are so excited to finally get the latest API into your hands!
